# MiniFRC-11-Orange-Opps-74

This robot competes in MiniFRC Reefscape, a custom, quarter scale version of the main season frc game for 2025. The primary objective that my robot was to consistently and quickly score coral on all 4 levels of the reef and score algae in the processor.

My robot completes these tasks by using a double jointed arm with a grabber claw combined with a floating intake roller on the chassis to intake and place coral as well as intake and kick out algae.
